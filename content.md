## Headline / Bio
Iâ€™m Michael, a front end developer with a passion for clean, modular code, intuitive interfaces, and an insatiable appetite for learning new things. I love the feeling of being presented with a challenge and breaking it down to creatively arrive at solutions.

## Experience at Zeeto
During my time with Zeeto I worked on a close knit team iterating on Agile sprints while managing multiple projects and employing a multi-tier git workflow. I was constantly pushed to think creatively in order to adapt designs to new requirements and unforeseen challenges while meeting tight deadlines.

At Zeeto I owned the development for the GetItFree registration funnel. I authored greenfield projects as well as continuously optimized the UI, UX and revenue for 12 variations of the site for target traffic sources. GetItFree is a leader in the lead generation space, garnering $10 million in annual revenue. Working with a client constantly seeking to innovate and push the needle I was required to think creatively and communicate effectively in order meet goals.

## Bankrate (Zeeto)

For this project I improved the UX for and rebuilt the introductory section for the Bankrate Credit Check Funnel using React. The implementation involved sending user data to the server, and awaiting a valid response from the server prior to displaying the call-to-action. By slowing down the speed of the loader bar I insured that the server had time to verify the user and the call-to-action could immediately be displayed. By cleaning up the previous implementation of state I improved code maintainability and prevented future bugs from being introduced.

Authored styles, markup and component organization and architecture. With this project I was able to put into practice the theming hierarchy I had architected using CSS preprocessors for writing scalable, modular yet flexible CSS that fit into React's component architecture

## Facebook Path Game (Post Registration)

I authored the styles, markup, and component architecture for the game section after registration. I was tasked with writing the markup, styles, and CSS animations for the game while another developer used my markup to build the game in React. This required us to work closely to plan implementation and coordinate changes to code.

## Why I Love the Web
in 2017 The web has woven itself into the fabric of the modern world and has almost incalculable cultural, educational, and economic value. It's a place where anyone can publish content, access a global network over a standard protocol and share their content with literally anyone else in the world. It is the ultimate democratizing medium. It has overthrown dictatorships and disrupted the status quo in countless ways. The best part is I can't help but think it's just getting started.
