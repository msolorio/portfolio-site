## Headline / Bio
Hello! I'm a front end developer with a passion for clean code, intuitive interfaces, and an insatiable appetite for learning new things. I love the thrill of diving into a challenge, breaking it down, and creatively arriving at solutions.

## Experience at Zeeto
At Zeeto I worked on a close knit team iterating on Agile sprints while managing multiple projects and employing a multi-tier git workflow. I authored greenfield projects as well as continuously optimized the UI, UX and revenue for 12 variations of a client registration funnel for target traffic sources. Working with a client garnering $10 million in annual revenue, I was pushed on a daily basis to think creatively and communicate effectively to meet goals.

## Testimoials
During our time on Zeeto's optimization team, Mike has been a pleasure to work with. He always came in with a positive attitude and we knew we could count on him to go the extra mile to make sure a project was given the correct attention to detail. Mike's dedication and drive to learning and taking his knowledge to the next level was always incredibly inspiring. I would highly recommend Mike for any future ventures in his development career and would happily work with him again.
- Brittan McGinnis, Team Lead at Zeeto.io

Michael, is a very detail oriented developer excited about growing his skills and giving everything he has to his passion. It was a pleasure everyday to work with Michael who was always even keeled and thoughtful. Even though Michael has chosen to look for new challenges beyond Zeeto at this time I fully support Michaels decision and respect his need to keep growing as a developer and look outside of Zeeto for that opportunity.

## Zeeto Work Examples

## Bankrate (Zeeto)
[https://creditcheck.bankrate.com/survey.html](https://creditcheck.bankrate.com/survey.html?pid=57900194ebf1f38522000000&vid=587ffc650970a29d1e0009b6&first_name=CarleyTest&last_name=Testingly&address=683+New+York+Ave&address2=Apt+4&city=Huntington&state=NY&zip=92107&mobile_phone=1647985576&email=testms-millenialdesktop-012717-1@zeetotest.com&gender=male&date_of_birth=1971-9-10&utm_source=zeetotest&utm_campaign=zeetotest&utm_medium=zeetotest&utm_term=zeetotest")

For this project I improved the UX for and rebuilt the introductory section for the Bankrate Credit Check Funnel using React and coordinated development with another team member overseeing styling. The implementation involved sending user data to the server, awaiting a valid response from the server, and displaying the call-to-action. By slowing down the speed of the loader bar I insured the server had time to verify user data and the call-to-action could immediately be displayed. By cleaning up the previous implementation of state I improved code maintainability and prevented future bugs from being introduced.

**Technologies Used**
React
JavaScript

## SCA Sweepstakes (Zeeto)
[https://i.getitfree.us/splash.html](https://i.getitfree.us/splash.html?vid=57e3fefccd7d10314f0053c5)

For this project I authored styles, markup and component architecture. I successfully implemented a theming hierarchy I created for making our funnel components iterable and iterable. Implementation of this architecture sped further initiatives and split testing by 3x.

**Technologies Used**
Less

## Implement Signup Logic
[http://g.getitfree.us/getFreebiesSignup?uf=duocleansers](http://g.getitfree.us/getFreebiesSignup?uf=duocleansers)

During a migration of one of our funnels from a React implementation to a CMS implementation, I was in charge of migrating the sign up page logic. The implementation from React to vanilla JavaScript needed to be flexible enough to account for the wide range of tracking and user data storing needed for the various Getitfree funnels and simple enough for various members of the team to make changes when needed.

## Currently Working On
I am currently building a modern web app with the Express framework, using Express Router, models, and ES6 modules to modularize and simplify my codebase.

## Why I Love the Web
In 2017 The web has woven itself into the fabric of the modern world and has almost incalculable cultural, educational, and economic value. It's a place where anyone can publish content, access a global network over a standard protocol and share their content with literally anyone else in the world. It is the ultimate democratizing medium. It has overthrown dictatorships and disrupted the status quo in countless ways. The best part is I can't help but think it's just getting started.
