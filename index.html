      <p class="paragraph">At Zeeto I worked on a close knit team iterating on Agile sprints while managing multiple projects and employing a multi-tier git workflow. I authored greenfield projects as well as continuously optimized the UI, UX and revenue for 12 variations of a client registration funnel for target traffic sources. Working with a client garnering $10 million in annual revenue, I was pushed on a daily basis to think creatively and communicate effectively to meet goals.</p>

      <blockquote class="teetoTestimonails_blockquote">During our time on Zeeto's optimization team, Mike has been a pleasure to work with. He always came in with a positive attitude and we knew we could count on him to go the extra mile to make sure a project was given the correct attention to detail. Mike's dedication and drive to learning and taking his knowledge to the next level was always incredibly inspiring. I would highly recommend Mike for any future ventures in his development career and would happily work with him again.

      </blockquote>

      <blockquote class="teetoTestimonails_blockquote">Michael, is a very detail oriented developer excited about growing his skills and giving everything he has to his passion. It was a pleasure everyday to work with Michael who was always even keeled and thoughtful. Even though Michael has chosen to look for new challenges beyond Zeeto at this time I fully support Michaels decision and respect his need to keep growing as a developer and look outside of Zeeto for that opportunity.

      <p class="project_description">For this project I improved the UX for and rebuilt the introductory section for the Bankrate Credit Check Funnel using React and closely coordinated work with another teammember overseeing styling. The implementation involved sending user data to the server, awaiting a valid response, and displaying the call-to-action. By slowing the speed of the loader I insured the server had time to verify user data and the call-to-action could immediately be displayed. By cleaning up the previous implementation of state I improved code maintainability and prevented future bugs.</p>

      <p>During the migration of a funnel from React to a CMS implementation, I was in charge of migrating the sign up page logic. The implementation from React to vanilla JavaScript needed to be flexible enough to account for the wide range of tracking and user data storing needed for the various Getitfree funnels and simple enough for various members of the team to make changes when needed.</p>

It's a place where anyone can publish content, access a global network over a standard protocol and share their content with literally anyone else in the world. It is the ultimate democratizing medium. It has overthrown dictatorships and disrupted the status quo in countless ways. The best part is I can't help but think it's just getting started.</p>
