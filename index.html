          <p class="paragraph project_description">For this project I improved the UX for and rebuilt the introductory section for the Bankrate Credit Check Funnel using React, closely coordinating work with another teammember overseeing styling. The implementation involved sending user data to the server, awaiting a valid response, and displaying the call-to-action. By slowing the speed of the loader I insured the server had time to verify user data and the call-to-action could immediately be displayed. By cleaning up the previous implementation of state I improved code maintainability and prevented future bugs.</p>
