      <p class="paragraph">At Zeeto I worked on a close knit team iterating on Agile sprints, managing multiple projects, and employing a multi-tier git workflow. I authored greenfield projects as well as continuously optimized the UI, UX and revenue for 12 variations of a client registration funnel for target traffic sources. Working with a client garnering $10 million in annual revenue, I was pushed on a daily basis to think creatively and communicate effectively.</p>

      <h3 class="headline headline-project">Bankrate</h3>
      <p class="paragraph project_description">For this project I improved the UX for and rebuilt the introductory section for the Bankrate Credit Check Funnel using React and closely coordinated work with another teammember overseeing styling. The implementation involved sending user data to the server, awaiting a valid response, and displaying the call-to-action. By slowing the speed of the loader I insured the server had time to verify user data and the call-to-action could immediately be displayed. By cleaning up the previous implementation of state I improved code maintainability and prevented future bugs.</p>

      <h3 class="headline headline-project">Sweepstakes</h3>
      <p class="paragraph project_description">For this project I implemented a theming hierarchy I created for making our components reusable and our registration funnels quickly themable. Implementation of this architecture sped further initiatives and split testing by 3x.</p>

      <p class="paragraph project_description">During the migration of a funnel from React to a CMS implementation, I was in charge of migrating the sign up page logic. The implementation from React to vanilla JavaScript needed to be flexible enough to account for the wide range of tracking and user data storing needed for the various Getitfree funnels and simple enough for various members of the team to make changes when needed.</p>

It's a place where anyone can publish content, access a global network over a standard protocol and share their content with literally anyone else in the world. It is the ultimate democratizing medium. It has overthrown dictatorships and disrupted the status quo in countless ways. The best part is I can't help but think it's just getting started.</p>
